# What is this?

This is an implementation I made for a [Frontend mentor challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca) to challenge myself a bit and have some fun with new tools. The site basically shows some info on all countries in the world using a REST API, allows for filtering of the countries by name and region and shows a detail page per country specifying 

TypeScript and ReactQuery were tools I never used before this project, and it was interesting/fun to use them
